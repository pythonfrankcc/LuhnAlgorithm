This is an implementation of the well known Luhn Algorithm that is used in financial institutions for checking the validity of cards

The important libraries used are:
a) windows.h in the case that the environment on which you will be running this is a windows, the use of this will enable one to call the 
Sleep() function
b) string - The ccNumber will be a string and thus neccessary

From there you are set, clone the project and build it.

You may consider looking at the dependencies that will change in the case of a linux environment.
